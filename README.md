# Restaurant Reviews project

This code is for a project from [Udacity's Front-End Developer nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001).

The goals of the project were:
* take a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use.
* add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience.

Since the original code was also hard to understand and had some parts that were out of date, I rewrote some of it while maintaining the same functionality. In particular, I updated all of the database functions to use the Fetch API instead of XHR.

## How to run

1. Download or clone this repository, and start up a local HTTP server in this folder. For example, if you have Python 2.x, you can use `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`. For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`.

2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`.

This was a course project and was put onto Github for grading, so unfortunately I cannot accept contributions. Thank you!
